.SH NAME
pam_timestamp_check \- check or clear authentication timestamps
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pam_timestamp [[-d]|[-k]] [target_user]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
With no arguments,
.B pam_timestamp_check
will check to see if the default timestamp is valid, or optionally remove it.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP -k
instead of checking the validity of a timestamp, remove it.  This is analogous
to sudo's
.B -k
option.
.IP -d
Instead of returning validity using an exit status, loop indefinitely,
polling regularly and printing the status on standard output.
.IP target_user
The default behavior of
.B pam_timestamp_check
checks or removes timestamps generated by
.B pam_timestamp
when the user authenticates as herself.  When the user authenticates as a
different user, the name of the timestamp file changes to accomodate this.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
When checking if a timestamp is valid,
.B pam_timestamp_check
returns an exit code of 0 for success and > 0 on error:

.nf
2: binary is not setuid-root
3: invalid invocation
4: user unknown
5: permissions error
6: invalid controlling tty
7: other error
.fi
