.SH NAME
pam_timestamp \- authenticate using cached successful authentication attempts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_timestamp.so
.br
.B session optional /lib/security/pam_timestamp.so
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
In a nutshell, pam_timestamp caches successful authentication attempts, and
allows you to use a recent successful attempt as the basis for authentication.

When an application opens a session using pam_timestamp, a timestamp file is
created in the \fItimestampdir\fP directory for the user.  When an application
attempts to authenticate the user, a pam_timestamp will treat a sufficiently-
recent timestamp file as grounds for succeeding.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP debug
turns on debugging via \fBsyslog(3)\fR.
.IP timestampdir=\fIname\fP
tells pam_timestamp.so where to place and search for timestamp files.  This
should match the directory configured for sudo(1) in the sudoers(5) file.
.IP timestamp_timeout=\fInumber\fP
tells pam_timestamp.so how long it should treat timestamp files as valid
after their last modification date.  This should match the value configured
for sudo(1) in the sudoers(5) file.

.SH EXAMPLE
\fB/etc/pam.d/some-config-tool\fP:
.br
auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_timestamp.so
auth required   /lib/security/pam_unix.so
.br
session optional /lib/security/pam_timestamp.so
session required /lib/security/pam_permit.so
.br
