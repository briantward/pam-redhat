pam-redhat
==========

PAM modules created and developed primarily for use in Fedora
and Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions. Because of their
limited use they are not included into the upstream Linux PAM
sources.

The modules are built inside the build tree of the upstream
Linux PAM modules. Unfortunately this means that the modules
cannot contain any strings which should be localized.
